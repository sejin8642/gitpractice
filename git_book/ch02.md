# Git Basics

### 1. Getting a Git Repository
* At the current directory, type the following command to initialize the directory as Git repository:
```
git init
```

* Once you add and modify files, use the following commands to make the first commit:
```
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
```

* The following command clones a Git repository from \<url\> into a Git repository named \<dir\> (If you did not specify \<dir\>, the default name from \<url\> will be used).
```
git clone <url> <dir>
```

### 2. Recording Changes to the Repository
* Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Track files are files that were in the last snapshopt (ummodified, modified, or staged). Untracked files are everything else.
![filestatus](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/lifecycle.png) Figure 7. The lifecycle of the status of your files.
 
* Use `git status` command to determine which files are in which state. If you have a new file that you did not stage using `git add <filename>`, it will be listed in untracked files from `git status` output.

* `git add <filename>` will track the new file, and you can check that it is listed in changes to be committed list from `git status` output. 

* Once you modify a tracked file, it will be listed under changes not staged for commit even if it was added previously. 

* `git status -s` or `git status --short` will give a more simplified output: A for staging area, M for modified files, ?? for untracked files. There are two columns to the output - the left-hand column indicates the status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the working tree.

* You can create .gitignore file inside the working tree directory to ignore files you don't want Git know about. Here are the examples:
```
# ignore all .a files
*.a

# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a

# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
/TODO

# ignore all files in any directory named build
build/

# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt

# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf
```
* `git diff` command  gives excactly what changes you made to files, but not yet staged. `git diff --staged` (or `git diff --cached`) command gives you what you staged that will go into your next commit. 

* `git commit` command commits your staged files to the repository. `-m` option can be added (followed by a commit message). 

* `git commit -a` command stages all modified files and commits the index afterward. 

* `git rm <filename>` removes the file from the working tree and add the file to the index (you can also run `rm <filename>` and `git rm`). It also removes the file from the working directory. The next time you commit, the file will be gone and no longer tracked. If you modified or had already added the file to the staging area, you must force the removal with the `-f` option.

* `git rm --cached <filename>` removes the file from the index, but the file is kept in the working tree.

* Git doesn't explicitly track file movement. If you rename a file in Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you renamed the file. `git mv file_from file_to` is the same as running these three commands
```
mv file_from file_to
git rm file_from
git add file_to
```

### 3. Viewing the Commit History
* `git log` lists the commits made in the repository in reverse chronological order. Option `-p` or `--patch` shows what `git diff` would show. `-(any number)` would limit the number of commits to be displayed by the number. `--stat` option shows abbreviated stats. `-pretty=oneline` option prints each commit on a single line.

* `git log --since=2.weeks` shows the list of commits made in the last two weeks (`git log --until` works simiarly). `--author` option can filter on a specific author, and `--grep` option lets you search for keywords in the commit messages. 

### 4. Undoing Things
* `git commit --amend` allows you to redo the previous commit (git add * means add all files in the current directory except for files whose name begin with a dot).

* `git add -A` stages all changes, `git add .` stages new files and modifications without deletions, `git add -u` stages modifications and deletions without new files. `git reset <file>` moves the file from the staging area to its previous place.

* `git checkout -- <file>` reverts changes made to the file (Git just replaces that file with the most recently-committed version, meaning any local changes made to the file will be gone). `git checkout <branch>` reverts the branch. If Git can't find a branch, then it will look for a file instead.      

### 5. Working with Remotes
* `git remote` shows remote servers you configured. `-v` option also shows the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and writing to that remote

* `git remote add <name> <remote_url>` command adds the remote server. You can download all the data you currently do not have in your current Git repository to the repository by running `git fetch <name>` from the remote server.

* `git fetch <remote_address>` goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from the remote project that you do not ahve yet. 

* `git push <remote> <branch>` command allows you to push your project upstream to share.

* `git remote show <remote>` shows more information about the remote. 

* `git remote rename <name_from> <name_to>` changes remote's shortname. `git remote remove <name>` removes the remote. 

### 6. Tagging
* `git tab` (with optional `-l` or `--list`) lists the existing tags.

* A lightweight tag is just a pointer to a specific commit, whereas annotated tags are stored as full objects in the Git database. 

* `git tag -a v1.0 -m "my version 1.0"` creates a simple annotated tag (`-a` option) with the tagging message.

* `git tag v1.1-lw` lightweight-tags the commit.

* You can also tag commits after you've moved past them by specifying the commit checksum (or part of it) when tagging as this: `git tag -a v1.2 <checksum>`

* By default, the `git push` command doesn't transfer tags to remote servers. But you can explicitly push tags by the following command: `git push origin <tagname>`. If you have a lot of tags that you want to push up at once, you can also use the --tags option instead. 

* you can use `git tag -d <tagname>` to delete the tag on your local repository (this does not delete tags on the remote server). Either `git push <remote> :refs/tags/<tagname>` or 'git push origin --delete <tagname>` will delete the tag on the remote server.

* You can `git checkout` a tag to view the version of files that the tag is pointing to (this will put your repository in detached HEAD state.
